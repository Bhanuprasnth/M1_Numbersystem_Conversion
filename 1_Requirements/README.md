# Features and Benefits of the project
*  Number systems are the technique to represent numbers in the computer system architecture, every value that you are saving or getting into/from computer memory has a defined number system.
*  As Computer architecture supports following number systems so we need to study them and also need to know the conversion technique between them
*  Binary number system
* Octal number system
* Decimal number system
* Hexadecimal (Hex) number system
